Retina Images
---------------------

Retina Images adds an option to all image effects included with core to allow them to output high resolution images for high DPI or retina displays.

When enabled as part of an image style, this module returns high resolution images for all devices, as is recommended and explained in Thomas Fuchs' excellent blog post and examples on this subject.

For more information on the subject I highly recommend Thomas Fuchs excellent book, Retinafy your web sites & apps.

For best results you may need to specify a custom quality setting for each image style, which can be done easily with the Image Style Quality module.
